Sure, I'll provide separate READMEs for part 1 and part 2.

## Part 1: Google Earth Engine (GEE) Code README

### Inputs Needed
1. Access to Google Earth Engine with appropriate permissions.
2. Access to relevant FeatureCollections for different blocks, district boundaries, and district-wise NREGA work data.

### Datasets Being Used
1. FeatureCollections for different blocks (`block1`, `block2`, etc.).
2. FeatureCollections for block boundaries (`blockBoundry1`, `blockBoundry2`, etc.).
3. FeatureCollections for district-wise NREGA work data (`district1_works`, `district2_works`, etc.).

### Function Description
1. `getYear(dateString)`: Extracts the year from a date string.
   - Input: A date string.
   - Output: The year extracted from the date string.

2. `foo(block_name, size)`: Processes NREGA work data for each block and exports the processed data to a CSV file.
   - Inputs:
     - `block_name`: Name of the block.
     - `size`: Size of the NREGA work data for the block.
   - Output: Processed CSV files containing categorized NREGA work data for each block.

### Outputs
1. Processed CSV files containing categorized NREGA work data for each block.
2. The CSV files are saved in Google Drive under the specified output directory (`output_dir`).

## Part 2: Google Colab Code README

### Inputs Needed
1. Access to Google Colab or a Python environment with the pandas library installed.
2. The CSV files containing NREGA work data exported from Google Earth Engine should be stored in Google Drive.

### Function Description
1. `foo(block_name, size)`: Processes NREGA work data for each block, categorizes the data based on work types and years, and exports the processed data into separate CSV files for each block.
   - Inputs:
     - `block_name`: Name of the block.
     - `size`: Size of the NREGA work data for the block.
   - Output: Processed CSV files containing categorized NREGA work data for each block.

### Outputs
1. Processed CSV files containing categorized NREGA work data for each block.
2. The CSV files are saved in Google Drive under the specified output directory (`output_dir`).
